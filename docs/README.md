### Overview

Featuring 2 reverse avalanche saw oscillators, tone and volume control, and a built in mult, this module is designed to be expanded by the Drone Follower module. By seperating additional oscillators from the main unit, expanding the drone requires less space in your rack and can be acheived with fewer parts.

### Design

One of our few purely analog modules, this module features an amplifier to boost the low level of the reverse avalanche oscillator to standard modular levels. A built in volume control allows you to dial in the ideal amouunt of drone in your mix. The transistors and capacitors can be socketed, making it easy to adjust the frequency range or each osscilator.

### Overview1

Featuring 3 reverse avalanche saw oscillators and tone control, this modules allows you to expand the Drone Master to feature as many oscillators as you would like. By moving some components to the master module, additional oscillators can be added with a smaller footprint and lower cost. While this module does function by itself, the Drone Master or another amplification module is needed to boost the signal to modular levels.

### Design1

One of our few purely analog modules, this module features three of the simplest oscillators possible. The transisistors and capacitors can be socketed, allowing you to experiment with different transistors and dial in the perfect frequency range.

### Buy

I'll be updating this part soon with a link to buy PCBs on Reverb. For the time being you can email me to purchase development PCBs at a discount. These will be fully functional but have minor issues
