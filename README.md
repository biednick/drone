# Drones

The drone features 3 oscillators and a tone control, which can be passivly mixed to combine as many oscillators as you want.

## Files
droneSlave_xx .brd and .sch
These are the board and schematic files needed to manufacture PCBs. Gerbers need to be generated in Eagle for manufacturing.

### slaveParts_xx.md
These are the parts lists for each module. A mouser BOM is available in this file as well.

### slavePanel.ai
These are the panels in Adobe Illustrator format. I make my panels on a laser cutter with 1/8 inch acrylic.
