# Drones

The drone has been split into 2 modules: A master, which contains 2 oscillators, a passive 3 channel mixer, and tone and volume control; and a slave, which features 3 oscillators and a tone control. I reccomend building 1 master for up to 5 slaves. This gives you 17 oscillators which is plenty for most people.

## Files

### droneMaster_xx and droneSlave_xx .brd and .sch
These are the board and schematic files needed to manufacture PCBs. Gerbers need to be generated in Eagle for manufacturing.

### masterParts_xx.md and slaveParts_xx.md
These are the parts lists for each module. A mouser BOM is available in this file as well.

### masterPanel.ai and slavePanel.ai
These are the panels in Adobe Illustrator format. I make my panels on a laser cutter with 1/8 inch acrylic.

## Updates

First push to GitHub. The slave module has been tested, but the master is untested.
